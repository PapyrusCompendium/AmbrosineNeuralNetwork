# AmbrosineNeuralNetwork
 WIP CPU Bound Neural Network. Once the project has been completed I will write an in depth how-to, on how this neural network works and how anyone could write one. Neural networks are simple once you wrap your mind around what it is actually doing.


# Advanced Vector Extensions
I am also working on a module that consumes the SIMD api for faster dot product calculation on layer propagation.
